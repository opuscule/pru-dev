               <p>Appropriate exercise: All dogs need regular exercise and stimulation.

You should follow a recommended nutritional program, including feeding only premium dog foods and veterinarian approved supplements. You should be careful not to under or over feed your puppy and, in particular, if your puppy’s breed is prone to hip dysplasia be careful not to over-feed your dog.</p>
               <p>Your puppy should be spayed or neutered at an age deemed appropriate by your veterinarian.</p>

This amount can be applied towards the purchase of a replacement puppy. Buyer will provide documentation from a licensed veterinarian stating the cause of death. A second opinion can be requested by Seller.</p>
               <p>The replacement value of the puppy is solely based on the original purchase price and does not include shipping costs, health certificate, crate, medical bills or any additional price declared by the Buyer.</p>
